#About
Site was created with create-react-app Typescript template. 
It is deployed via an automated CI/CD pipeline using Vercel. Effort was made to create the site in a modular, component based way and thus would be easy to use as a template for creating portfolios as well as being easy to update with new projects.
The goal is that by simply updating the config file, this code can be used as a template for any portfolio.
